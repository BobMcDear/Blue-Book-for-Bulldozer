# Blue Book for Bulldozers Competition on Kaggle

This notebook is for the [blue book for bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers) on Kaggle, and our aim is to predict the auction price of heavy equipment given past data. Our best score beats the first place solution on Kaggle, although the test sets used aren't identical. You can find the accompanying blog for this notebook [here](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/blue-book-for-bulldozers-competition-part-1-basic-data-pre-processing-1248cd5d4214) and a Colab version of the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ksY7QO8CScISnEvNyj4_G2i27gKSEoLu?usp=sharing).
